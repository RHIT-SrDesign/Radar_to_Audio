How to use wav.py
wav.py is the python file that takes the simulated iq data in and outputs a .wav file called "audio.wav" that then can be played. the syntax is as follows: 

wav.signal2wav(mf.sample_rate,npData);
mf.sample_rate = sample rate of the signal
npData = simulated iq data

This command should store the audio.wav file into the same destination where the wav.py file is stored, so finding that file shold be simple for playing later.
